# NetServa HCP (RC2)

This is a lightweight Web, Mail and DNS server with a PHP based **Hosting
Control Panel** for servicing multiple virtually hosted domains. The operating
system is based on the latest Debian or Ubuntu packages and can use either
SQLite or MySQL as a backend database. The entire server can run in as little as
256 MB of ram when paired with SQLite and still serve a dozen lightly loaded
hosts so it is ideal for LXD and Proxmox virtual machines and containers. It
depends on the [NetServa SH] shell scripts being installed first.

## Hosting Control Panel

This project is ideal for [LXD containers] or cheap 256MB to 512MB VPS plans.

- [NetServa SH/HCP] does not reqire Python or Ruby, just PHP and Bash
- Fully functional IMAP/SMTP mailserver with personalised Spam filtering
- [LetsEncrypt] SSL enabled [nginx] web server with [PHP FPM 7+]
- Optional [PowerDNS] installation for local LAN or real-world DNS service
- Always based and tested on the latest release of [Ubuntu Server]
- It can use either [SQLite] or [MySQL] as database backends
- A fresh SQLite based install uses about 70MB ram (without Wordpress)
- The "compiled" single file PHP script is less than 200KB in size
- Built from the ground up using [Bootstrap 5] and [DataTables]
- Developed and tested using LXD containers on the latest [Plasma Desktop]

## Usage

The PHP web interface relies on the [NetServa SH] scripts being installed on the
primary and target hosts so the first thing to do, as root...

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markc/sh/main/bin/setup-sh ; . setup-sh

_Please first review the very simple script with "cat setup-sh"._

This installs the `SH` (Shell Helper) aliases and scripts into a `/root/.sh`
directory and activates the environment variables and special aliases. See the
[NetServa SH] repo for more information about how to use these aliases and
scripts directly. This `HCP` project is just a web based frontend for the `SH`
system which does all the real provisioning and management work.

The first step, after installing the `SH` scripts, is to make sure the current
host has a hostname and a domainname. The domainname needs to be valid if using
a publically accessible server and that needs the assistence of a real DNS
service. Otherwise, if using a local LAN with private IPs (like 192.168.\*,
10.\* or 172.\*) then you can make up any domainname as long as your are
consistent within your local LAN. Using something like `netserva.lan` is a good
candidate unless you prefer something else. The hostname of your current host
computer is usually determined when the OS is installed but can be changed by
editing `/etc/hostname` and making sure `/etc/resolv.conf` has a reference like
`search netserva.lan`. Once you get results like this...

    ~ hostname
    myhost
    ~ hostname -d
    netserva.lan
    ~ hostname -f
    myhost.netserva.lan

(where `myhost` and `netserva.lan` are your real or made up names) then continue
on with the next step.

Now we "normalize" the host by using `setup-host` which updates the primary
hosting **Desktop** or **Server** system to Bionic 18.04 (unless `os release` is
defined.) using the current `hostname -f` unless a **hostname.domainname** is
passed in as the first `[domain]` argument...

    Usage: setup-host [fqdn] [(mysql)|sqlite]

Assuming a LXD container is to be used for the actual server side (recommended
for initial testing anyway) then use `setup-lxd` to install and setup the basic
LXD container system...

    Usage: setup-lxd [pool size (25) GB] [passwd] [IP] (WIP)

We can now setup the actual NetServa SH/HCP system for testing so, for example,
if we use something like `c1.netserva.lan`, where `c1` will be the container
label and `netserva.lan` can either be a real domainname (if the server has a
public IP) or whatever internal LAN-wide domainname you care to use...

    Usage: newlxd FQDN [(small)|medium|large] [distro(bionic)] [(mysql)|sqlite] (WIP)

If the installation procedure can detect an externally available public IP then
it will attempt to install a LetsEncrypt SSL certificate so that the web server
can be accessed via `https` and the mail server will be SSL enabled and ready
for real-world deployment. Otherwise a self-signed certificate will be installed
(which can be a problem for Firefox.) The mail, web, sftp and HCP login
credentials will be available in `cat ~/.vhosts/$(hostname -f).conf`.

The essential configuration settings for the default server will be inside the
container (example only for a local LAN domain called `netserva.lan`)...

    lxc exec c1 bash
    cat ~/.vhosts/$(hostname -f)

Or, if you already have a containter or remote server ready to use after a fresh
Ubuntu or Debian install then you could install the entire NetServa SH and HCP
system by ssh'ing into the system (or for example, "lxc exec c1 bash" for a
local LXD container) and...

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markc/sh/main/bin/setup-sh
    # cat setup-sh
    . setup-sh
    setup-all

This may take 5 to 15 mintes to complete depending on the bandwidth available to
the target server. Once finished you should be able to go to
`https://c1.netserva.lan/hcp` and login to the HCP web interface using the
simple sitewide HTTP `sysadm/1234` authentication first then the real admin
username and password available with `cat ~/.vhosts/$(hostname -f).conf`.

## Config Override

The main `index.php` file is actually the configuration for the entire program
so that the rest of the PHP files could actually be included from anywhere else
on the system (not just from `lib/php`) if the `INC` const is changed. To
override the default settings (so sensitive information is not committed to some
Git repo) a config override file can be put anywhere (the default being
`lib/.ht_conf.php`) in which an array is returned where any of the top level
property array values can be overridden. First review the main [index.php] file
top level properties then compare below as an example of how to override these
property values...

    <?php
    return [
        'cfg' => ['email' => 'YOUR@EMAIL_ADDRESS'],
        'db' => ['type' => 'mysql', 'pass' => 'YOUR_MYSQL_PW'],
        'out' => [
            'doc'   => 'YOUR_SITE_LABEL',
            'head'  => 'YOUR_SITE_LABEL',
            'foot'  => 'Copyright (C) 2018 YOUR_SITE_LABEL',
        ],
    ];

which would change the default email address (for forgotten password etc) to
your email address, set the database to use MySQL with it's password and change
the site titles and footer copyright notice. The SH/HCP system will use MySQL by
default so if you use...

    setup-all $(hostname -f) sqlite

for an extremely lightweight system (minus Wordpress) then use a
`lib/.ht_conf.php` override file like...

    <?php
    return [
        'cfg' => ['email' => 'YOUR@EMAIL_ADDRESS'],
        'db' => ['type' => 'sqlite'],
        'out' => [
            'doc'   => 'YOUR_SITE_LABEL',
            'head'  => 'YOUR_SITE_LABEL',
            'foot'  => 'Copyright (C) 2018 YOUR_SITE_LABEL',
        ],
    ];

Another alternate option for a MySQL password is to create a simple plain text
file called `lib/.ht_pw` and put ONLY the MySQL password in that file but of
course using `lib/.ht_conf.php` instead allows you to modify or extend any of
the top level properties in `index.php`.

The point of the config override is so you can keep doing a `git pull`and update
the HCP web area (either from the NetServa repo or your own fork) without
interference from locally updated files, and `git push` (to your own git repo)
will not upload passwords to a possible public git repo.

## Athentication

During installation five random passwords will be auto-created in
`/root/.vhosts/$(hostname -f)` along with a `/root/.my.cnf` with `DPASS` if
MySQL is being used. Example...

    ~ grep PASS ~/.vhosts/$(hostname -f)
    APASS='LheTZOT8eYCrlAk8'  # Admin HCP password
    DPASS='axVps7OIXb7VY4uT'  # Database password, if using MySQL
    EPASS='a5cBBxXL59uAyJkc'  # SMTP/IMAP password for admin@$VHOST
    UPASS='D8G3RgpBgSetyG4o'  # SFTP password
    WPASS='LheTZOT8eYCrlAk8'  # Wordpress admin password, if using MySQL

The initial `sysadm` user has access to most of the server with SUDO permissions
to the provisioning scripts in `/root/.sh/bin/*`. This user also "owns" the
default `YOUR_DOMAIN/adm` web area with the NetServa HCP web interface. All
extra virtual hosts will be owned by `u1000 u1001 u1002 etc` system users which
will be chrooted, or locked into, their respective VHOST web area. For
instance...

    ~ shhost
    sysadm  c1.netserva.org                          /home/u/c1.netserva.org
    u1001   netserva.org                             /home/u/netserva.org
    u1002   netserva.com                             /home/u/netserva.com
    u1003   netserva.net                             /home/u/netserva.net

where the above resulted from...

    ~ newlxd c1.netserva.org
    # then SSH/exec into the container and...
    ~ addvhost netserva.org
    ~ addvhost netserva.com
    ~ addvhost netserva.net

The authentication point being that using SSH or SFTP (ie; from Dolphin) to this
server as...

    ~ ssh -p9 sysadm@netserva.org
    # or for KDE kio
    sftp://sysadm@netserva.org:9/

would result in access to the whole (non-root) file system whereas...

    ~ ssh -p9 u1001@netserva.org
    # or for KDE kio
    sftp://u1001@netserva.org:9/

would chroot or lock access to the `/home/u/netserva.org` area with no
possibility of using SUDO so folks only interested in working on a web site have
reasonably safe access to only that web area.

`setup-ssh` can be used on the host to manage local SSH keys making logging in
to a container or remote server much easier...

    Usage: setup-ssh domain [targethost] [user] [port] [sshkeyname]
